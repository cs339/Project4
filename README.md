# Assignment 4 (Project)
## REFACTORING to Design Patterns in the Large (Design for Change)

In this homework, you are required to come up with a solution on the movie rental program to support
new features in new requirements as follows:

1. Your new program must support different types of items including movies, video games, music
CDs and books. You should support different categories of movies, music CDs, DVDs, and books.
You must anticipate other new types of items as well.
2. Your new program must support not only renting, but also selling those items.
3. You should provide basic functions to support renting and selling transactions for those items in
the store.


Please submit your resulting code and a short Word document explaining the rationale behind your
changes. You could work in a group of 2-4 persons.
(Note: I post this assignment on the request of the students who would like to start early, i.e., before the
break. It won’t affect the due date of the assignment. The spring break time won’t be part of this
assignment)
